- **Cost Tracking**: Calculate monthly and annual software expenditures.
- **Modular Architecture**: Organized into logical packages (core, utils, data).
- **Data Validation**: Robust input handling to ensure data integrity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+

## Project Context
This system was developed as part of the **Fullstack Django Bootcamp (ABP#3)**. It follows **PEP 8** standards and emphasizes the use of modular logic and advanced data structures like lists, dictionaries, and sets.
